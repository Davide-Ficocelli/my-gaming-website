            <h2>About the game</h2>
            <p>
                Elden Ring is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco
                Entertainment.
                It was released in February 2022 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and
                Microsoft
                Windows.
                The game is set in a dark fantasy world and features an open-world environment with a focus on
                exploration
                and combat.
                Players take on the role of a customizable character known as the Tarnished, who is tasked with
                restoring
                the Elden Ring and becoming the Elden Lord.

            <h2>Why I like it</h2>
            <p>
                I love the variety of playstyles available in the game. You can decide to be a wizard, a tank, an
                assassin, a knight and more. You can even mix different builds together to have the best of both worlds.
                Having played Dark Souls 3 and Skyrim, I thought a game that combines the open world exploration of
                Skyrim and the combat mechanics of Dark Souls would have been amazing, and so it was. Not to mention the
                possibility to play with friends in co-op mode, which adds a whole new layer of fun to the game.
