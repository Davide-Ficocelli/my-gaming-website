            <h2>About the game</h2>
            <p>
                God of War III is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony
                Computer Entertainment. Released in 2010 for PlayStation 3, it concludes Kratos' revenge story against
                the Olympian gods. The game features brutal combat with chained blades, epic boss battles against Greek
                deities, and cinematic set pieces that push the PS3 hardware to its limits.

            <h2>Why I like it</h2>
            <p>
                I remember being hyped for this game while I was playing the previous installments, I couldn't wait to
                get to God of War III. To this day I can say the hype hasn't been disappointed. What I've been loving
                the most about this game is the music and sound effects, especially the track "Rage of sparta" which
                always gets me pumped up. The story was quite engaging, and although good graphics aren't usually an
                important aspect to me when it comes to judging a game, I have to say that God of War III really stood
                out to me having played the previous ps2 games which were of course not as graphically impressive and I
                didn't
                mind that.
