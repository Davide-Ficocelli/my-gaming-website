                Japan and published by Konami. Released in 2001 for PlayStation 2, it follows rookie agent Raiden as he
                infiltrates an offshore cleanup facility to rescue hostages from a terrorist group. The game features

            <h2>Why I like it</h2>
            <p>
                MGS2 blew my mind with its meta-commentary on sequels and player expectations. The bait-and-switch from
                Snake to Raiden was controversial but brilliant, making me question the connection to digital
                characters. This is one of those games I appreciate more as I get older. The metal gear saga is one of
                those which details are not caught in the first playthrough. In fact I was at first confused by the
                story, but with further research and rewatches I realized how deep Kojima's writing is. The uncanniest
                part of this game for me was the pre-final boss speech of the patriots's AI. As I was listening, it was
                easy for me to forget that this game was released in 2001 because of the scary accuracy of the AI's
                speech about the digital age as we know it today. Besides this, the game is a masterpiece to me also due
                to its central theme of memes (academic meaning). It had me relfecting on the origin of information and
                how it spreads.
