            <h2>About the game</h2>
            <p>
                Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios where players explore a blocky,
                procedurally-generated 3D world. With no specific goals to accomplish, players can gather resources,
                craft tools, build structures, and fight creatures. The game features multiple modes including survival
                (with health and hunger) and creative (with unlimited resources).

            <h2>Why I like it</h2>
            <p>
                Minecraft is a piece of history the way I see it. It was the game which accompanied me through not only
                my childhood but also my teenage years. Although I've never been a big fan of building structures, the
                game still has a lot to offer to who likes exploration and adventure. This game becomes even better if
                played with others in your world or on public servers.
                This game has been a part of my life for so long that it taught me valuable lessons especially since I
                used to spend a lot of time playing on servers, especially in the vanilla mode. I've experienced making
                new allies, fighting alongside them, losing them, being betrayed and having what I've built destroyed.
                Despite all of this I always kept going. Doesn't sound that different from the real world, does it?
                Coming back to the game itself, you don't like the vanilla or default experience the game has to offer?
                No problem!
                There are thousands of mods out there which can change the game to your liking. You can even play it in
                a different genre, like RPG or FPS. The possibilities are endless! And you can even enjoy minigames on
                servers like bedwars, skywars and many more whether you play alone or with friends. Furthermore, I think
                I've never seen a game that is present on so many platforms like Minecraft is. You can play it on your
                phone, tablet, nintendo switch and 3DS and even on your browser.
