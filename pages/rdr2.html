            <h2>About the game</h2>
            <p>
                Red Dead Redemption II is an open-world western action-adventure game developed by Rockstar Games. Set
                in 1899, it follows Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang during the decline of the Wild West.
                Players explore a massive world spanning five fictional U.S. states, engaging in gunfights, hunting,
                horseback riding, and making moral choices that affect the story.

            <h2>Why I like it</h2>
            <p>
                No game has immersed me like RDR2. From brushing my horse to watching sunsets over the prairie, every
                detail creates a living world. Arthur Morgan's journey is one of gaming's greatest character arcs,
                transforming
                from ruthless enforcer to remorseful anti-hero. The attention to detail is staggering, whether it's
                tracking animals through snow or hearing campfire stories that develop over months. It's less a game and
                more an interactive masterpiece of Western fiction, and this is coming from someone who doesn't even
                particularly like westerns. RDR2 managed to change my mind about the genre through its storytelling and
                immersive world. I've played almost the entire game in first person mode, not only because I found it
                more comfortable, but because it made the experience feel even more real. This allowed me to notice more
                details in the gameplay that were more difficult to see in third person. For instance, how you need to
                manually pull down the hammer of your revolver by pressing the fire button before shooting, and hand to
                hand combats when they were featured in the game.
                The music was so good it made me get closer to the country music genre, which I didn't quite explored
                before.
