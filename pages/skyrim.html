            <h2>About the game</h2>
            <p>
                Skyrim is an open-world fantasy RPG developed by Bethesda Game Studios, released in 2011. Set 200 years
                after Oblivion, players take the role of the Dragonborn - a hero with the power to absorb dragon souls.
                The game features a massive world with mountains, forests, dungeons, and cities to explore, alongside a
                deep character progression system with skills that improve through use.

            <h2>Why I like it</h2>
            <p>
                What I love the most about Skyrim is its immersive world and the music it offers. Its music is so good I
                can use it while studying or working. The game allows for endless exploration and adventure, and if this
                weren't enough, mods are available in a large variety. Similarly to Elden Ring, you can decide your
                playstyle as you have many skill trees to choose from. Although it's no secret the game contains certain
                glitches like being able to steal items without getting caught by simply putting a basket on someone's
                head, these kind of glitches aren't annoying at all, instead they're funny to watch to me. All the more,
                Skyrim will always have a special
                place in my heart as it's a game I used to play a lot during my childhood.
